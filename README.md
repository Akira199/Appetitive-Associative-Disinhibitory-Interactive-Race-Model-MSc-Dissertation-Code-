# Appetitive-Associative-Disinhibitory-Interactive-Race-Model-MSc-Dissertation-Code-
This code focuses on building the new variant of the Interactive Race Model of Action Suppression 

%% Current folder contains the code for simulating the Appetitive Associative Disinhibitory Interactive Race Model %%
%% NilosmitaBanerjee_MSc_DissertationCodeFiles %%
%===============================================================================================%
The main model code is taken from source code of Boucher et.al.,(2007) model code 
Changes to the main code script Model_AADI-RM is still underway 
SSRT script calculates one of the main variables of interest in the current study - SSRT i.e., stop signal reaction time referes to the hidden latency during action suppression/successful inhibition (impaired in current study participants)
Main script file contribution made by AkiraB -- Unit_ActivationCode (which contains the new augmented Appetitive Disinhibitory activation diff eq with lambdaGO and lambdaSTOP param for the GOUnit/STOpUnit) along with the rest of the code that simulates the activation of the GOUnit and STOPUnit during Stop Signal Task
